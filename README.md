### Project Title
U.S. Bikeshare Data analysis


### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

In this project, I will use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States i.e. Chicago, New York City, and Washington. And use python to read csv files into Pandas dataframe and analyze the data to answer business questions about it by computing descriptive statistics as well as write script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
